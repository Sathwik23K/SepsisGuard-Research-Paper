# SepsisGuard-Research-Paper

Developed an intelligent healthcare solution integrating Arduino-based sensors, cloud analytics (ThingSpeak), and a Random    
Forest ML model to detect sepsis in real-time. Achieved high accuracy in monitoring vital signs and delivering automated SMS alerts to hospital 
staff. Designed for deployment in rural settings to enhance early sepsis intervention.
